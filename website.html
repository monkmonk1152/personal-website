                <h3>Christopher started work young, He was always taught to work hard, 
                do it right and be proud of his work. Timothy, Christopher's older brother, 
                taught him how to cook. He started off as a busser in two resturants before being a cleaning crew guy at Hooters. 
                One day at Hooters there was only one cook and he needed help so he pulled Christopher in kitchen to cook. 
                From that day on he cooked at hooters and the resturant with his brother. He became a trainer and manger over time and then worked as a line Chef,
                under Chef Williams. When she moved she asked him to be her Sous chef but he couldnt move that far from his family. Christopher went to EMS school soon after he tried to join the Navy but do to his health was turned away.
                As he worked these other jobs, he always cooked, he loved the art of it and learning how to cook so many different types of food.
                Christopher in his eary 20's got into constrution, he did a couple different types and enjoyed it but he tore his body apart. See Christopher wanted a job he loved and enjoy,
                one it balanced out home life as well. He tried so many, warehouse to delivery for amazon, but it wasnt him. Now he works for a farm he loves, driving flowers and he is in school for coding.
                Christopher learned many skill sets and still uses many of them, but he wants to see the world and work remote, he is looking to have a family and see places he has never been.
                He wants to set the bar for his family, he refuses to work a job he hates but is always learning new things. See Christopher loved cooking but had no life, being a robot in a warehouse wasnt him, 
                but with coding he can keep learning and expanding and one day run his own company, for that has always been his dream. </h3>
